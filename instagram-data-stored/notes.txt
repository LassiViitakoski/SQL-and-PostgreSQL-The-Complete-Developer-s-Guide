Performance with Postgres
  -> You can get away with quick tips and hints
  -> Much easier to understand performance if you understand the internals
  -> Take a look at how data is stored and accessed
  -> Investigate at how indexes are stored and used
  -> Put these together to understand how queries are executed

How the data is REALLY stored
  -> Heap or Heap File
    -> File that contains all the data (rows) of our table
  -> Tuple or Item
    -> Individual row from the table
  -> Block or Page
    -> The heap file is divided into many different 'blocks' or 'pages'.
    -> Each page / block stores some number of rows.
