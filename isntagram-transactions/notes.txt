BEGIN;
  -> Start transaction

COMMIT;
  -> End transaction and commit changes

ROLLBACK;
  -> End transaction and revert queries done after BEGIN;

Running a bad command will put the transaction in an 'aborted' state - you must rollback
Losing the connection (crashing) will automatically rollback the transaction
