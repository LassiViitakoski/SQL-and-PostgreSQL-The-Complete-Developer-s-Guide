Important Notes on Recursive CTE's
  -> Very, very different from simple CTE's
  -> Useful anytime you have a tree or graph-type data structure
  -> Must use a 'union' keyword - simple CTE's don't have to use a union!
  -> This is super, super advanced, I don't exprect you to be able to write your own
  -> recursive CTE's - just understand that they exist!
