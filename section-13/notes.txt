  -> Numbers *
  -> Date/Time *
  -> Character *
  -> Boolean *
  -> Currency
  -> Binary
  -> JSON
  -> Geometric
  -> Range
  -> Arrays

Numeric Types
  -> smallint
  -> integer
  -> bigint
  
  -> smallserial -> 1 to 32767
  -> serial -> 1 to 2137483647
  -> bigserial

  -> decimal
  -> numeric

  -> real
  -> double precision
  -> float

  -> real, double precision and float are more inaccurate than decimal and numeric
  -> but they are more efficient to do calculations

Numeric Types Fast Rules
  -> 'id' column of any table -> Mark the column as serial
  -> Need to store a number without a decimal -> Mark the column as integer
  -> Need to store a number with a decimal and this data need to be very accurate
    -> Bank balance, grams of gold, scientific calculations
      -> Mark the column as numeric
  -> Need to store a number with a decimal and the decimal doesn't make a big difference
    -> Kilograms of trash in a landfill, liters of water in a lake, air pressure in a tire
      -> Mark the column as double precision

Character Types
  -> CHAR(5) -> Store some characters, length will always be 5 even if PG has to insert spaces
  -> VARHCAR -> Store any length of string
  -> VARCHAR(40) -> Store a string up to 40 characters, automatically remove extra characters
  -> TEXT -> Store any length of string
