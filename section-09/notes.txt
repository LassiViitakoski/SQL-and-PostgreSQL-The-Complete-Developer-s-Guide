Subqueries can be used as
  -> A source of a value ->  SELECT p1.name, (SELECT  COUNT(name) FROM products)
  -> A source of rows ->     FROM (SELECT * FROM products) AS p1
                             JOIN (SELECT * FROM products) AS p2 ON p1.id = p2.id
  -> A source of a column -> WHERE p1.id IN (SELECT id FROM products);

Understanding the shape of query result is key of underderstanding subqueries!
SELECT * FROM orders -> Returns many rows and many columns,
SELECT id from orders -> Returns many rows and one column
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders -> Returns one row and one column (single value) <- Scalar query

In the SELECT statement we can only write subqueries which return single value
In the FROM statement we can write any subquery, so long as the outer SELECTs / WHEREs / etc are compatible
